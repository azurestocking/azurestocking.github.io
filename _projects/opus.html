title: "Orchestrating Storytelling for Content Creators with Integrated Video Generation Workflow"
desc: "Opus was an expanding Pre-Series A startup specializing in AI-powered short video repurposing and captioning, now aiming to integrate a text-to-video generation feature into its current product amid limited resources and intensifying market. Yet this loosely defined but potentially valuable opportunity needed to be validated and conceptualized before securing leadership buy-in. Our research yielded data-driven insights through iterative prototype-based testing, uncovering diverse user segments and their varied expectations and shared high-level goals, culminating in a design proposal for an end-to-end, human-AI collaborative storytelling support tool."

                <h5>üî• Market Interest</h5>
                <p>The recent advancement of generative AI has fueled momentum in multimodal creation, with text-to-video emerging as a compelling frontier. Well-backed startups like Pika and Runway signal both technical feasibility and strong market demand.</p>

                <h5>üöÄ ‚ÄúExistential Crisis‚Äù</h5>
                <p>The client is among the earliest players in AI-powered video captioning and repurposing, but the low barrier to entry makes differentiation essential to maintain its competitive edge as more industry giants enter the space, such as OpenAI Sora, Adobe Firefly, and ByteDance CapCut.</p>

            <p>When users conceptualize high-level goals differently, they inevitably adopt distinct positions on the value trade-offs. Such divergence logically points to multiple user segments, which should be evident from their clustering along these trade-off spectrums.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I mapped all those stickers onto two axes that represent core tensions in users‚Äô decision-making: <b>Cost vs. Perceived Quality</b> and <b>User Agency vs. Automation</b>.</p>

            <p>The company has successfully raised $30M in Series A in August 2024 and $20M in Series B in March 2025, but ultimately chose not to ship the storyboard or any 0-1 generative feature, likely due to a strategic pivot toward monetizable, lower-risk enhancements to its core captioning feature amid the intensifying competition.</p>

                <p>With research-driven startups like Sand.ai raising technical benchmarks and niche players like Katalist.ai gaining early traction, the increasingly complex landscape made it more prudent to focus on strengthening current revenue drivers before expanding into new verticals with fragmented use cases.</p>

                <p>If the feature had been shipped, at launched, track activation rate, export rate, and usage frequency to measure evaluate initial user engagement and to identify early signals of perceived value. Over time, monitor user retention lift and conversion rate to evaluate long-term business impact and sustained behavior change.</p>
