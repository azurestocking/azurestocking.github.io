            <p>The observed conflicting feedback unveiled divergent user expectations and behaviors, rooted in how users conceptualized the shared high-level goals differently and hence their distinct positions on value trade-offs. This indicates multiple user segments, which should be logically inferable by their clustering on these trade-off spectrums.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I mapped all those stickers onto two axes that represent core tensions in users’ decision-making: <b>Cost vs. Perceived Quality</b> and <b>User Agency vs. Automation</b>.</p>
