    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div class="grid grid-2-0">
        <div>
            <p>The team needed to quickly and affordably validate a loosely defined but potentially valuable opportunity without diverting core production efforts. Therefore, as an external consultant, I was brought in to lead a focused rapid prototyping sprint, navigating ambiguity and trust issues amid limited support, vague requirements, and low internal priority.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="grid grid-3">
        <div class="card">
            <h4>üí∞ Tight Budget</h4>
            <p>The company is an early-stage startup preparing for Series A with a small team and limited resources, lacking bandwidth for a full-time hire.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>üí™ Fueling Market</h4>
            <p>The company is among the earliest players in AI-assisted captioning, but the space has a low barrier to entry, making differentiation more critical.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h4>ü§ù Potential Synergy</h4>
            <p>The company has received user feedback requesting a text-to-video feature, indicating synergy with existing capabilities.</p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <div class="grid grid-2-0">
        <div>
            <p>We set off with a knowingly over-simplistic problem framing that lacks the clear understanding of user needs, workflows, or success criteria:</p>
            <blockquote>How might we add a text-to-video feature to our product?</blockquote>
            <p>Don‚Äôt be hasty to frown! In the subsequent design cycles, we used prototype-based testing to elicit user feedback, surfacing real needs and progressively clarifying the problem space:</p>
            <blockquote>How might we empower content creators to quickly and easily translate their scripts into reliably high-quality videos while accommodating diverse scenarios?</blockquote>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <div class="p-l">
        We proposed an end-to-end tool for AI video production, built on a multistage generative media pipeline focused on collaborative workflow enhancement rather than dependence on powerful models, enabling faster iteration, consistent output, and creative control from scripting to shot management.

            <p>The observed conflicting feedback unveiled divergent user expectations and behaviors, rooted in how users conceptualized the shared high-level goals differently and hence their distinct positions on value trade-offs. This indicates multiple user segments, which should be logically inferable by their clustering on these trade-off spectrums.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I mapped all those stickers onto two axes that represent core tensions in users‚Äô decision-making: <b>Cost vs. (Perceived) Quality</b> and <b>User Agency vs. Automation</b>.</p>
