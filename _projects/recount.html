title: "Empowering Survivors in Legal Preparation via Trauma-Informed Testimony Restructuring"
desc: "Our AI agent supports survivors of traumatic incidents—especially domestic violence—during the judicial preparation phase by transforming fragmented, emotionally charged memories into structured, legally usable narratives. Through a guided interview process powered by RAG and knowledge graph integration, the agent helps users construct coherent timelines, detect evidentiary gaps, and generate draft affidavits in formal legal language. Designed to reduce narrative burden and prevent re-traumatization, it bridges systemic gaps in early-stage legal engagement."
